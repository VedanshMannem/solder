# solder

First time making PCBs & messing with circuits

I wanted to learn more about transistors and came across a pretty cool design on YouTube. I wanted to do something similar but also incorporate the motor disc, so I made a PCB with alternating lights and a button to turn on the motor. 

## BOM:
1. BatteryHolder_Keystone_3034_1x20mm	1
2. CP_Radial_D8.0mm_P5.00mm	2
